### Dart JTransc target

Since Google has put a lot of effort on Dart, and seems that FuchsiaOS will to be programmed in Dart.
It seems like a good idea to create a Dart target to be prepared for the future. I'm going to use C# target
as base for Dart.
Also DartVM seems like a good alternative to node.js for the server and lighter than the JVM while being typed.
